SciLor's Mashed Trainer is the first trainer for the game Mashed Fully Loaded (not for Mashed!).

I recommend using DXWnd to put the game into windowed mode for better usage of the trainer.

## Features
### Player
- Change/Freeze points
- Revive player
- Teleport player
- Freeze players position
- Freeze players controls (except weapon)
- Equip and Drop weapons.
- Damage and Repair the car

### Game
